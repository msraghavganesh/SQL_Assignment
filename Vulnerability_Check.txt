This is a sample text file to check the vulnerability in vs code.

After a brief introduction about myself, the presentation's agenda will move on to the project's goals and deliverables. We'll quickly go over the highlights of my internship project. We will examine several cost categories that are having a significant impact as we go deeper into the cost study. We'll investigate ExxonMobil's competitiveness in parallel and compare our findings to those of the IPA. We will then move on to the outcomes of the cost and schedule analysis and make suggestions therefor. We'll wrap up with the project's future scope and its impact on the current system.

From the past 2 months, Iam working on US Gulf coast Cost estimate accuracy study. As a Cost Engineer intern, under the supervision of Farah and guidance of my Mentor Siva, We worked on an objective to conduct a cost estimate accuracy study and to provide recommendations on potential adjustments to future estimates and to supplement target setting discussions. The Primary output of my project was: <<DELIVERABLES>>

After having a full understanding of all the parameters and variables I had to deal with, I came across limitations of Power BI and the way how its often done, So I came up with an innovative way to crunch the data in a quick, short and efficient way by using my programming skills. It potentially saved a tremendous amount of time to extract the data and clean it. My dataset has roughly 50 projects ranging from 1$ to 12$. I wanted to automize the entire process, from fetching the data, extracting the data, sanitizing the data, and plotting relevant data and using Advanced Machine Learning concepts to automatically identify anomalous data and raise an exception error.

To validate my source, I was in frequent touch with the Benchmarking team and interacted with cost engineers from various portfolios to understand their estimating methodologies. We incorporated mainly two approaches for the Cost analysis, We ran through all cost categories while holding the portfolio constant, in simpler words, We were looking at the performance of each portfolio as an individual and analyzed trends. The alternative strategy was to see how the cost category is varying across different regions and come up with recommendations for the same.
The image on the right is a sample IPA Cost summary form, Cell B-11 to B19 are various cost category buckets and respective estimated cost is provided. My python scripts automatically detects the IPA sheet, picks up a specific cost category, slices the dataset and create a data frame in python and bundle it in as a package called "Object". I have used a Jupyter Notebook instance inside my Visual Studio code. It creates an environment for me to build a program with specific versions of dependencies and sets up the kernel for me. In layman's terms, If you put an IPA Cost summary sheet in a specified location which is mapped, My code automatically correlates each cell across 50 different projects and creates a relational mapping. We extended the scope of the project to Joliet region.

This is one of the graphs from my dashboard, This speaks about the EM capital investment breakdown. From my dataset, The percentage contribution of each cost category bucket is analyzed.  We can see that Construction Labor (CL) constitutes to 29.56% of the total actual cost. Detailed engineering contributes to roughly 14% and bulk materials to 12%. The motive behind this analysis is to spend quality time on cost categories which make a significant impact on the total cost. For example, If we analyze, Detailed engineering and come up with recommendations, Any change or improvement in this cost category bucket will change the total actual needle, but whereas the other categories wont change the needle significantly. From my research, CL, DE, BM are not stand alone categories, As I'm from a mechanical background, Gears is the first thing which came to my mind for chain reaction. It can be visualized as gear mechanism with auxiliary gears. If there is a change in Bulk materials, It means there needs to be a change in detailed engineering, and in turn more labor hours are required than usual. If we move one gear, it will influence the remaining two. We then focused our research more on these 3 categories to certain depth rather than touching all cost categories in a surface level.

We observed a consistent overrrun in BTAP portfolio for Construction Labor. It had an average overrun of 26.29%. When we expanded our research, with my interactions with several Cost Engineers from all portfolios, We found that some of the projects followed a slightly different estimation methodology. Some had ALL in WAGE and some adopted Wage rate per hour. We wanted to normalize the dataset, and with further research, we planned to combine two cost category buckets, namely Construction Labor and Other Construction Related Cost. We then observed that we need to expand our dataset to find trends. One of our recommendations for BTAP region is that, When they are carrying out this study further, they should focus more deeply on their Construction Labor Estimation vs actuals. As Construction labor is influenced by bulk materials and detailed engineering buckets, IPA Reports validate our statement BM is one of the major driving forces behind Construction Labor.

Moving on to Detailed engineering, We used a slightly branched out approach to analyze the trends. We categorized the dataset into two categories. SMALL CAPS which are less than 5 million usd and EMCAPS which are greater than 5M USD. We saw a consistent trend which all projects behaved. For small CAPS project there was an underrun of 11.25% and EMCAPS had Overrun of 19.6%. Irrespective of the portfolio, The small capital projects behaved very similar. When further researched, most of the Bigger capital projects (EMCAPS) they had many change orders post Gate3, which led to spike in Actuals. Some had change in execution strategy, some projects had scope changes etc. One key take away from this is, for all the small caps project, we can take these numbers for the target setting discussions. IPA Reports says that the project that set competitive cost targets tend to achieve competitive results.This target setting recommendation would guide is to be more competitive.
